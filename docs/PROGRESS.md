# SCAE Progress Log

## April 2025

### Workflow Navigation and Cookie Management (April 21-22)
- Fixed workflow navigation: "Next" and "Previous" buttons now reliably advance and regress through steps.
- Resolved bug where "Next" button was unresponsive due to stray closing brace in `renderer.js`.
- Improved `showStep` logic to correctly manage required attributes and visibility for all steps.
- Enhanced debugging output for step transitions and button event listeners.
- Cookie dropdown and management UI now fully functional:
  - `loadCookiesUI` reliably loads and populates saved cookies.
  - Dropdown and delete/select controls work as intended.
  - Added robust error handling for missing/invalid cookies.
- TinyMCE and EasyMDE editors now initialize only when DOM is ready.
- All UI feedback and error messages now visible in the status bar.

### Troubleshooting and Debugging
- Added detailed console logs for workflow navigation and UI state.
- Fixed timing/race condition with step initialization and DOM element readiness.
- Improved error messages for missing DOM elements (e.g., navigation buttons).
- Documented all major bugs and fixes in `/docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `/docs/PROGRESS.md`.

### WordPress Integration Success (April 22)
