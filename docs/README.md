## April 2025 â€“ Workflow Navigation & Cookie Management

April 21-22: Major bugfixes for workflow navigation and cookie management. The "Next" button now reliably advances steps, cookie dropdown and management UI is fully functional, and error handling is improved. See [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) for ongoing troubleshooting and detailed updates.

We are currently debugging a timing/race condition affecting the clipboard extraction method in the GenSpark automation workflow. A polling-based clipboard read was implemented to improve reliability, but the clipboard content is still sometimes not detected. See PROGRESS.md for ongoing updates.
