# StackBounty Content Automation Engine – Progress & Changelog

## April 18, 2025

### **Recent Fixes and Improvements**
- **Prompt and Image Strategy Dropdowns:**
  - Fixed population and selection of saved prompts and image strategies from localStorage.
  - Ensured backward compatibility for previously saved items with normalization logic.
  - Now, both dropdowns initialize immediately on app load and refresh when navigating to the Options step.
- **EasyMDE Editor Integration:**
  - Markdown editors for both prompts and image strategies now use EasyMDE for editing and previewing.
  - All content is read and written directly from the EasyMDE instance, ensuring accurate saves/loads.
  - Removed all custom preview boxes in favor of EasyMDE's built-in preview.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Toolbar icons are now clearly visible with improved styling.
  - Error messages and status logs are shown in the UI to help with debugging and user feedback.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Prevented errors when saving image strategies by ensuring prompt content is always retrieved from EasyMDE.
  - Cleaned up debug logging and removed raw JSON output from the UI.
- **Logo & Featured Image Management:**
  - Added logo selection dropdown with CRUD (upload, load, delete saved logos).
  - Added featured image input supporting URL, upload, and paste from clipboard.
  - Inline previews for both logos and featured images.

### **How It Works Now**
- When the app loads, both dropdowns populate with saved prompts/strategies from localStorage.
- When navigating to the Options step, dropdowns refresh to reflect any new additions or deletions.
- Saving a new prompt or image strategy updates the dropdown and persists to localStorage immediately.
- All editing is performed through EasyMDE, so formatting and previewing are consistent.

### **Known Issues / Next Steps**
- Migration of storage from localStorage to electron-store for true persistence.
- Further UI polish and workflow enhancements.
- Integration with GenSpark, OpenAI, and WordPress APIs.

### Clipboard Extraction Debugging
- Implemented clipboard polling (up to 10 tries, 200ms apart) after GenSpark copy action to address race condition.
- Despite polling, clipboard method still sometimes fails to detect the article ("No article found (clipboard)").
- Possible causes: browser async clipboard update, Puppeteer click not triggering copy, or OS-level clipboard issues.
- Next steps: deeper investigation into Puppeteer click reliability, alternative extraction methods, and user/system clipboard permissions.

## April 29, 2025 – Image Strategy & Prompt Section Overhaul

### Major Fixes and Enhancements
- **Image Strategy Dropdown & Editor Wiring:**
  - Refactored all event wiring (`change`, `Load`, `Delete`, `Save as New`) for image strategy dropdown and buttons to occur strictly inside `initApp`, preventing duplicate listeners and variable redeclaration errors.
  - Removed all redundant global-level event bindings for image strategies, fixing the "Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable" errors.
- **Auto-Loading & Editor Population:**
  - Ensured that both GenSpark prompt and feature image prompt auto-load their content into their respective EasyMDE editors when entering the Options step and on app load.
  - Improved `populateImageStrategyDropdown` and `updateImageStrategyFieldsFromDropdown` to robustly populate and refresh the EasyMDE editor when a strategy is selected.
- **Debugging and Developer Experience:**
  - Added detailed `console.log` debug output to all major dropdown and button handlers for easier troubleshooting.
  - UI now clearly reflects changes in dropdown selection, and all editor refreshes are visible in real time.
- **Button Functionality:**
  - Fixed "Save as New Image Strategy" button so it reliably saves and switches to the new strategy.
  - Load/Delete/Save buttons for image strategies are now fully responsive and update the UI instantly.
- **General UX:**
  - Dropdowns and editors are always in sync, and all state changes are immediately visible to the user.

### Documentation & Next Steps
- Updated `/docs/PROGRESS.md` and `/docs/README.md` to reflect all troubleshooting, fixes, and new best practices for dropdown/editor management.
- Next: Continue to monitor for edge-case bugs and begin integrating OpenAI/GenSpark APIs.
